 				<div class="topgap20 font-18">
 					Exhibit C
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					Certain Risks Reing to Purchase, Sale and Use of Tourcoins
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					Important Note: As noted elsewhere in these Terms, the Tourcoins are not being structured or sold as securities or any other form of investment product. Accordingly, none of the information presented in this Exhibit C is intended to form the basis for any investment decision, and no specific recommendations are intended. Company expressly disclaims any and all responsibility for any direct or consequential loss or damage of any kind whatsoever arising directly or indirectly from: (i) reliance on any information contained in this Exhibit C, (ii) any error, omission or inaccuracy in any such information or (iii) any action resulting from such information.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					By purchasing, holding and using Tourcoins, you expressly acknowledge and assume the following risks:
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					1. Risk of Losing Access to Tourcoins Due to Loss of Private Key(s), Custodial Error or Purchaser Error
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					A private key, or a combination of private keys, is necessary to control and dispose of Tourcoins stored in your digital wallet or vault. Accordingly, loss of requisite private key(s) associated with your digital wallet or vault storing Tourcoins will result in loss of such Tourcoins. Moreover, any third party that gains access to such private key(s), including by gaining access to login credentials of a digital wallet or vault service you use, may be able to misappropriate your Tourcoins. Any errors or malfunctions caused by or otherwise related to the digital wallet or vault you choose to receive and store Tourcoins, including your own failure to properly maintain or use such digital wallet or vault, may also result in the loss of your Tourcoins. Additionally, your failure to follow precisely the procedures set forth in Section 4 of Exhibit B for buying and receiving Tourcoins, including, for instance, if you provide the wrong address for receiving Tourcoins, may result in the loss of your Tourcoins.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					2. Risks Associated with the Ethereum Protocol
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					Because Tourcoins and World Tourism are based on the Ethereum protocol, any malfunction, breakdown or abandonment of the Ethereum protocol may have a material adverse effect on World Tourism or Tourcoins. Moreover, advances in cryptography, or technical advances such as the development of quantum computing, could present risks to Tourcoins and World Tourism, including the utility of Tourcoins for obtaining Services, by rendering ineffective the cryptographic consensus mechanism that underpins the Ethereum protocol.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					3. Risk of Mining Attacks
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					As with other decentralized cryptographic tokens based on the Ethereum protocol, Tourcoins are susceptible to attacks by miners in the course of validating Tourcoins transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, including, but not limited, to double-spend attacks, majority mining power attacks, and selfish-mining attacks. Any successful attacks present a risk to World Tourism and Tourcoins, including, but not limited to, accurate execution and recording of transactions involving Tourcoins.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					4. Risk of Hacking and Security Weaknesses
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					Hackers or other malicious groups or organizations may attempt to interfere with World Tourism or Tourcoins in a variety of ways, including, but not limited to, malware attacks, denial of service attacks, consensus-based attacks, Sybil attacks, smurfing and spoofing.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					5. Risks Associated with Markets for Tourcoins
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					There could be illiquidity risk with respect to Tourcoins you hold. Secondary trading of Tourcoins may be facilitated by World Tourism or third party exchanges, but such exchanges may be relatively new and subject to little or no regulatory oversight, making them more susceptible to market-related risks. Furthermore, to the extent that third-parties do ascribe an external exchange value to Tourcoins (e.g., as denominated in a digital or fiat currency), such value may be extremely volatile and diminish to zero.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					6. Risk of Uninsured Losses
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, Tourcoins are uninsured unless you specifically obtain private insurance to insure them. Thus, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer, such as the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, or private insurance arranged by us, to offer recourse to you.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					7. Risks Associated with Uncertain Regulations and Enforcement Actions
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					The regulatory status of Tourcoins and distributed ledger technology is unclear or unsettled in many jurisdictions. It is difficult to predict how or whether regulatory agencies may apply existing regulation with respect to such technology and its applications. It is likewise difficult to predict how or whether legislatures or regulatory agencies may implement changes to law and regulation affecting distributed ledger technology and its applications, including World Tourism and Tourcoins. Regulatory actions could negatively impact World Tourism and Tourcoins in various ways, including, for purposes of illustration only, through a determination that Tourcoins are a regulated financial instrument or security that require registration and/or licensing. Company may cease operations in a jurisdiction in the event that regulatory actions, or changes to law or regulation, make it illegal to operate in such jurisdiction, or commercially undesirable to obtain the necessary regulatory approval(s) to operate in such jurisdiction.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					8. Risks Arising from Taxation
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					The tax characterization of Tourcoins is uncertain. You must seek your own tax advice in connection with purchasing Tourcoins, which may result in adverse tax consequences to you, including withholding taxes, income taxes and tax reporting requirements.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					9. Risk of Alternative Platforms
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					It is possible that alternative platforms could be established that utilize the same open source code and protocol underlying World Tourism and attempt to facilitate services that are materially similar to the Services. World Tourism may compete with these alternative platforms, which could negatively impact World Tourism and Tourcoins, including Tourcoins’s utility for obtaining Services. The Company will seek to limit such competition through the filing for and use of patents, yet there are risks that the Company will be unsuccessful in doing so.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					10. Risk of Insufficient Interest in World Tourism or Distributed Applications
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					It is possible that World Tourism will not be used by a large number of individuals, companies and other entities or that there will be limited public interest in the creation and development of distributed platforms (such as World Tourism) more generally. Such a lack of use or interest could negatively impact the development of World Tourism and the potential utility of Tourcoins, including its utility for obtaining Services.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					11. Risks Associated with the Development and Maintenance of World Tourism
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					World Tourism is still under development and may undergo significant changes over time. Although we intend for Tourcoins and World Tourism to follow the specifications set forth in Exhibit A, and will take commercially reasonable steps toward those ends, we may have to make changes to the specifications of Tourcoins or World Tourism for any number of legitimate reasons. This could create the risk that Tourcoins or World Tourism, as further developed and maintained, may not meet your expectations at the time of purchasing Tourcoins. Furthermore, despite our good faith efforts to develop and maintain World Tourism, it is still possible that World Tourism will experience malfunctions or otherwise fail to be adequately developed or maintained, which may negatively impact World Tourism and the potential utility of Tourcoins, including its utility for obtaining Services.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					12. Risk of an Unfavorable Fluctuation of Ether and Other Currency Value
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					The Company team intends to use the proceeds from selling Tourcoins to fund the maintenance and development of World Tourism, as described further in Section 6 of Exhibit B. The proceeds of the sale of Tourcoins will be denominated in Ether, and may, at our discretion, be converted into other cryptographic and fiat currencies. If the value of Ether or other currencies fluctuates unfavorably during or after the Sale Period, the Company team may not be able to fund development, or may not be able to develop or maintain World Tourism in the manner that it intended.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					13. Risk of Dissolution of the Company
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					It is possible that, due to any number of reasons, including, but not limited to, an unfavorable fluctuation in the value of Ether (or other cryptographic and fiat currencies), decrease in Tourcoins’s utility (including its utility for obtaining Services), the failure of commercial relationships, or intellectual property ownership challenges, World Tourism may no longer be viable to operate and the Company may dissolve.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					14. Risks Arising from Lack of Governance Rights
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					Because Tourcoins confer no governance rights of any kind with respect to World Tourism or Company, all decisions involving World Tourism or Company will be made by Company at its sole discretion, including, but not limited to, decisions to discontinue World Tourism, to sell more Tourcoins for use in World Tourism, or to sell or liquidate the Company. These decisions could adversely affect World Tourism and the utility of Tourcoins that you hold, including Tourcoins’s utility for obtaining Services.
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20 font-weight-500">
 					15. Unanticipated Risks
 				</div>

 				<div class="topgap20">
 					Cryptographic tokens such as Tourcoins are a new and untested technology. In addition to the risks included in this Exhibit C, there are other risks associated with your purchase, holding and use of Tourcoins, including those that the Company cannot anticipate. Such risks may further materialize as unanticipated variations or combinations of the risks discussed in this Exhibit C.
